            <span className="text-blue-600">Frontend Developer</span> with a

            My journey started with a curiosity for how websites work, and it
            grew into a full-on love for building modern, fast, and accessible
            web apps. From solving complex UI problems to collaborating on
            real-world projects, I enjoy the full cycle of frontend development.

            When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me exploring new tech,
            polishing UI details, or helping peers with their web development
            journeys.
